•	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
  
o	Theater had the highest failure ratio and cancellations however it has been the most successful campaign listed. 
o	Films & Video and the music category trended with higher success as many of the commitments were honored giving it a higher probability of success.
o	Journalism appears to not have any appeal in the crowdfunding space. 
•	 What are some limitations of this dataset?

o	In my opinion one of the main limitations is the fact that reasoning why a campaign failed or succeed has not been provided.

•	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?

o	Create a Pivot table to compare the date created conversion vs date ended conversion to figure out how long it took for a successful campaign to be completed.
